              <p>"Scream all you want," I continued. "This hideout is located miles from any town or road. No one will ever hear you. In this little world of ours, I'm your only friend. I will feed you, talk to you when I want to, and do things that need be. If you're not nice to me, you'll never see the daylight again. Do you understand?"</p>
              <p>"I despise you," she said savagely. </p>
              <p>"Well I'm very sorry to hear that," I said with a shrug. "But your attitude will not help you at all princess." I stood up and walked to the door. </p>
              <p>"Wait!" she called out. "Aren't you going to remove my restraints?" </p>
              <p>Her question made me smile to myself. "Say please," I said. Her jaw clenched. "Are you freaking kidding me?" she said loudly. </p>
              <p>"I don't think her highness would appreciate your smart mouth princess." I faced her and grinned widely. "I'll only remove that if you say please." She closed her eyes for an instant and deliberated whether to say it or not. She thought better of it and said, "Please remove it."</p>
              <p>I walked back to her and leaned down so I could untie the ropes. "See? I know there's some manners left in you," I teased. She pursed her lips and didn't reply. I knew she was angry at me for kidnapping her and doing this. But who cares? I had my own reasons. </p>
              <p>My hands deftly removed the knots on the rope. Once she was untied, the princess moved her hands around and sat on the edge of the bed. She stunned me by elbowing my stomach and running to the direction of the door. Years of judo training kicked in. I pounced on her and pinned her to the ground where I straddled her.</p>
              <p>"You shouldn't have done that," I told her. "My stomach is going to bruise. You're lucky that I don't have a photo shoot right now." She writhed against my grip. "What are you saying? Let me go this instant!"</p>
              <p>"I'm warning you princess. If you do that again, I'll rip your clothes off and let you stay here completely naked." That made her stop. "When I release you, you're going to walk back to the bed. Understand?" She nodded. I stood up and helped her to her feet. She headed to the direction of the bed and sat down as instructed. </p>
